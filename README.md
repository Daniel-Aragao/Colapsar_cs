People most commonly use searchs between two points in the graph, for example get home from work by car have two points 
that should be the origin, work, and the destination, home.

This algorithmns uses the principles of searchs but between two regions, a set of points and not just one, as origin 
and destination. The pratical example is a bus network where an user should chose one bus stop to get in the bus and 
another to leave the bus, these two are origin and destination respectively using regions when the user don't know where 
is the best bus stop to use in a radius from where he is and how far he is willing to walk until he get to a bus stop. 
The same is valid when he don't know where to leave the bus trying to go home and have some specific disposition to 
walk there.

This project can be associated as a research project provided by LEC (Laborat√≥rio de Engenharia do Conhecimento in 
portuguese that means Knowledge Engineering Laboratory) and it's being developed as my monography. When the project is 
finalized the results will be presented here.
